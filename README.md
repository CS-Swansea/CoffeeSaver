Coffee Saver
============

Coffee Saver is a project to create a reusable and versatile *cap* for an open bag of coffee granules, which can be printed on a 3D Printer.

The main CAD software used for this project is [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) with additional functionality provided by [Dan Kirshner's OpenSCAD Threading Library](http://dkprojects.net/openscad-threads/threads.scad). 

Printing
--------

In the Swansea University (UK) Computer Science Department we have a [Makerbot Replicator 2X](http://store.makerbot.com/replicator2x) 3D Printer with Dual Extruders. Testing of the print quality and design should be assumed to be using this hardware unless otherwise stated.
